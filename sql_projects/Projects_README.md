# SQL Projects
Welcome to the projects section. Here I'll post all the projects I worked using SQL!

Since SQL is a quick way to extract data, I'm mostly will use to answer some business questions in different industries.
In each project folder, you'll find:
- Topic
- Database reference
- Objectives
- Business questions

Since I'm using Jupyter to make notes step- by step, this is also a good resource to study SQL!

## Project order
I'll write down the list of projects, starting from the 'basic/beginner' level and increasing in proficiency:

- [Supermarket Sales](https://github.com/Ana-Akaishi/sql-projects/blob/main/sql_projects/supermarket_sales):  Retail industry, analyzing branches about general sales, customer behavior, product performance, revenue trends, operational insights. **BEGINNER LEVEL**

- [Movie Review](https://github.com/Ana-Akaishi/sql-projects/tree/main/sql_projects/movie_review): Entertainment industry, using different databses to analyse popularity, directors productivity, rating, actor and actresses and TV shows vs Movies. **INTERMEDIARY LEVEL**

# SQL Study
Welcome to SQL Study page! Here I list all resources I used on my SQL journey. Most people are scared of SQL because it seems complicated but it's actually quite intuitive.

There are plenty of courses and other resources for you to check, but here I'll list the material I used to study.

## Road Map
The first issue when we try to learn a new skill is **where do I start?**. So to answer this question, here is the [road map](https://roadmap.sh/sql) I used. This is a great tool to learn, it gives you step by step and free resources to read and learn.

### To read
For **beginners** that enjoy reading and advance on their own, try [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp). It covers the basic SQl funcstions and some quick exercises.

### To watch
For **beginners**, I watched this [SQL Course, by Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S_tz1z_5bA&t=276s). It shows how to install a MySQL to write your queries, basic functions and how to modify data inside your dataset.

## Practice
The best advice I can give you is find a topic you like. After that try answering some business questions related to it. I know datasets are king od hard to find, but there's always kaggle!

If you want to focus on practicing coding for interview coding questions, I recommend use [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). This website has coding interviews tagged by skill (beginner, intermediary and advanced), difficulty and topic.
